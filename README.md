# Clockwork - a game engine from scratch

The goal of this project is to build a game engine, I still don't know what it needs to do, but will update this README as things progress.

The purpose of this repo is to document my journey and all my findings throughout the project. The [clockwork-kb](./clockwork-kb) sub-folder is an [Obsidiant Vault](https://obsidian.md/), feel free to clone and check it out. I don't know if I'll ever finish this project but that doesn't matter, I'm more excited to start it.

## Guide:

For a start, I'll be following the tutorial series by: [Travis Roman](https://github.com/travisvroman) called [TypeScript Game Engine Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv8Ddw9K0JPiTHLMQw31Yh4qyTAcHRnJx).

This will envolve a lot of copying and pasting before adding my own custom stuff. You may be wondering why I'm using TS, well, it's what I use in my day job, so, I might aswell keep using and webgl seems fun, so why not.

P.S: I might switch to C++, later on, who knows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

## Projects Using this Engine

I think the first game I'll build using this game engine will be a 2D tower defense game, anyone remember Zuma?

## Future Plans:

### Project to do:

-[x] Use Vite (WIP)
-[ ] Remove namespaces and switch to modules.
-[ ] Update all undefined checks to null checks and make use of the new TS features.
-[ ] Ship package to github packages.

### Engine to do:
