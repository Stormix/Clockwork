# Clockwork - a game engine from scratch

The goal of this project is to build a game engine, I still don't know what it needs to do, but will update this as things progress.

The purpose of this repo is to document my journey and all my findings throughout the project, feel free to clone and check it out. I don't know if I'll ever finish this project but that doesn't matter, I'm more excited to start it.

I moved the rest of this README to TheVault [README.md](https://github.com/Stormix/TheVault/blob/main/1.%20Projects/Clockwork/Clockwork.md).
